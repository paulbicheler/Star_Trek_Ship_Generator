#Introduction
This project is using snapsvg.io to create vector graphics of Star Trek-like spaceships.

Most spaceships of the [United Federation of Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets) in the Star Trek universe follow the same pattern:
+ A Saucer section. Basically a round(ish) shape that resembles a saucer.
+ A main body that is often thinner than the diameter of the saucer.
+ A neck that connects the saucer with the main body.
+ Two wings attached to the body with a pod attached at each end. These nacelles have a [red tip](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Bussard_collector) and often a blue line along its side.

#How it works
Each part of the ship has a point to which the other parts are attached to. With a lot of magic values you can draw these parts and align them using those points to create a whole ship.

There is a little variance to each part but not enough to recreate all of the ship featured in the TV-shows and movies. Most resemble one of the famous USS Enterprise .
